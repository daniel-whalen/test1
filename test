#The key has become an important icon in Palestinian’s struggle for the right to return.
##More so than an icon, my essay will argue, the key also functions as a potent mnemonic device.
###In this regard, the right to return is a struggle fought within the terrain of memory. Judith Butler has argued that it is dangerous to attempt to think the problems of Israel, as a Jew, using a solely Jewish ethics. Following Butler, I use a conceptual vocabulary provided by the Martinican intellectual Édouard Glissant to interrogate two ethical avenues through which Israel might navigate the memory of the Nakba and the right to return:
   1) The first ethical model is endemic to the insistence that Israeli identity, and therefore Jewish identity, because Israel is a purportedly Jewish state, is ‘rooted’ in the sands of the Levant. This is the attitude prevailing in Israel today. Glissant critiques rootedness as totalitarian because of its tendency towards generalization and universalization. Following Glissant, I argue that papering over Palestinian history in the territory with 3000-year old claims precludes any healing of the trauma of the Nakba, precisely because such claims have become the grounds upon which the right to return is denied.
   2) The second ethical model is born from the Jew’s own experiences of dispossession and diaspora. Glissant’s concept of ‘errantry,’ the sacred and indeed foolish quest to understand the Other, knowing full well that the Other can never be known, will be useful in this regard for errantry supersedes any sense of rootedness. Identity is formed by relation, then, and not by root. An errant ethical approach would not privilege one group or the other’s claim to ownership of the territory of Israel.
   I conclude that by shifting from a model of relation based on competing claims of rootedness to a model of relation based on shared (yet unimpeachably unique) experiences of being unrooted, the full mnemonic power of the key becomes realized. The key symbolizes the Palestinian right to return, and ostensibly its purpose is to reopen the homes of the disposed; in doing so, I wonder if an important blockage in the history of Judaism will also be unlocked. Thus, I conclude by asking if Jews can claim to have understood the lessons learned during the diaspora until the precise moment that the right to return is [realized][1].
